# Project description:
This is an implementation of a synthesiser based on subtractive synthesis. This type of synthesis starts from a waveform at which a filter is applied. The type of waveform can be chosen by the user (between sine, square, sawtooth, triangle and white noise) and its frequency is controlled by a MIDI input. The user can also choose between three types of filter (lowpass, highpass and bandpass) and can modify some parameters of it.
